# Game project

The game is a rogue like auto shooter I am working on in my spare time, as a fun project, with the intent of releasing one day. It is made using Unity and C#.

The player controls a robot that has health, battery and heat rescources. Moving, shooting and placing bridges an barriers drains the battery. Shooting and moving also produce heat that will damage the player when too high. 
Bridges create a path between parts of the map, and barriers can be used to block the enemies. Both are temporary, and have a cooldown after use.

The enemies spawn outside camera view and will move towards the player and attack when within attack range. They use the unity navmesh system to navigate the map. There are currently 4 types of enemies. Small melee, ranged, exploding when near the player, and bigger melee wiht higher damage and health.

Between rounds, the player can uses points, collected by destroying enemies, to upgrade stats and weapons, or reroll to get a new set of upgrades to purchase.
